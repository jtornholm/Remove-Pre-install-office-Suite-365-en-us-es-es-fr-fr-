Script To Silently Uninstall Built-In Office 365

Many Windows 10 computers come with three versions of ClickToRun Office 365 pre-installed (EN, ES, FR) that have to be uninstalled before you can install any other version of Office.

It's a real hassle to do this manually through the Add/Remove Programs GUI when you're setting up multiple computers.

This script will get the uninstall path from the Windows Registry and execute the command with a DisplayLevel=False flag to make the uninstallation silent. 

Simply click on the code button above and select download zip. Then Run the batch file.
